### Hi visitor ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Program Manager** working on the **WinUI product** at **Microsoft**. 

WinUI is a U.I. Framework, so I work on the presentation layer area. This layer renders the controls, like a button, and makes it possible to click on it, to do an action. WinUI uses XAML as markup language because it is the evolution of UWP XAML, UWP XAML comes from SilverLight ( âš° R.I.P.), and SilverLight was the little brother of WPF. So  WinUI, UWP, and WPF have a lot in common and, as a consequence, I'm fluent in the 3 platforms. 
WinUI also works with .NET and C++ so C# and C++ are the two languages more used by me.  Although being honest, I prefer write in C#.

There is more. Visual Studio is always opened in my computer, in addition to other PM tools like PowerPoint, Word, Markdown editor. The reason is that **I create developer and user experiences to enable Windows developers can create great applications**.  Isn't that cool?

These days I'm **leading all the WinUI strategy and execution to make the platform works with the Win32 app model**. If you are curious, read this [blog post](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2020/07/07/a-deep-dive-into-winui-3-in-desktop-apps/). 

More things about me. I'm from Spain, [Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville) (you should visit my hometown) and now I live in Seattle. I have a passion for computers since I was a kid. I learned how to create things programming in GWBASIC with 11 years old, and  I created my digital catalog for my Marvel comic book collection 12. When I was a teenager, around 15, I started to create video games in C language. Before being a PM I was a developer for several years, researcher,  developer advisor (software evangalist was called in the past), and Application Development Manager.
