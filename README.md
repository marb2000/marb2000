### Hi visitor ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Product Manager (PM) working at Google on the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) team.

I love my job - creating software products, and even more so when I have to create products for developers. There's a lot of beauty in designing frameworks and tools and making it possible for millions of developers to build apps.

Prior to that, I was a Product Manager at Microsoft working on Windows OS, Windows Runtime, Windows App SDK, and WinUI - in addition to that I had a lot of fun working with smart people on .NET and Visual Studio teams too.

More about me. I'm from Spain, [Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville) (you should visit my hometown), but I live in Seattle. I came here in 2012. I fell in love with computers as a child when I learned how to create things by programming in GWBASIC at the age of 11. I develop my digital catalog for my Marvel comic collection at 12 (I love books and comics). When I was around 15 years old, I was creating games in C and ASM. Before becoming a product manager, I was a developer, researcher, developer evangelist, and application development manager for several years. Also, Microsoft awarded me the Valuable Professional in ASP.NET (.NET web development) award.
