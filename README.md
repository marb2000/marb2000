### Hi visitor ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Product Manager (PM) working at Google on the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) team.

Before that, I was a Product Manager at Microsoft, working on Microsoft's Windows App SDK and WinUI products on the Windows Developer Experience team.

More things about me. I am from Spain, [Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville) (you should visit my hometown), but I live in Seattle, I came here in 2012. I fell in love with computers as a child when I learned to create things by programming in GWBASIC at 11 years old. I created my digital catalog for my Marvel comic collection at 12 (I love books and comics). When I was around 15 years old, I created video games in C and ASM. Before becoming a product manager, I was a developer, researcher, developer evangelist, and application development manager for several years. In addition, Microsoft awarded me the Valuable Professional in ASP.NET (.NET web development) award.

You can contact me here, on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marbtweeting) account or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelrb/)

Thank you very much for reading this!
