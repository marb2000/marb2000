Hi visitor ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Product Manager (PM) at Google where I work on developer experiences (leading many SDKs for multiple languages and platforms), including generative AI experiences for developers. I love crafting software products, especially those designed for developers. I get a lot of satisfaction from creating frameworks and tools that empower millions of developers to build innovative apps.

Prior to my current role, I was a PM at Microsoft where I worked on Windows OS, APIs, and SDKs. I helped create user experiences for Windows itself and enabled developers to create great apps for it. Some SDKs and tools where I put my energy were Windows Runtime, UWP, Windows App SDK, and WinUI. Additionally, I had the privilege of collaborating with brilliant minds on the Azure, .NET and Visual Studio teams, among others.

Iâ€™m from [Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville), Spain, a beautiful city that you should visit. Iâ€™ve been living in Seattle since 2012. Iâ€™ve been fascinated with computers since I was a kid. Iâ€™ve always loved books and comics, so by 12, I had developed a digital catalog for my Marvel comic collection in Clipper. When I was around 15, I started developing games using C and ASM. Before I started working as PM, I spent several years as a developer, researcher assistant, developer advocate, and application development manager.
