### Hi visitor ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Product Manager (PM) working on **Microsoft's Windows App SDK and WinUI products** in the Windows Developer Experience team. My goal is to **enable developers can create great apps in Windows with exceptional user experiences**.   

The Windows App SDK is an SDK for creating Windows apps, and one of its components is [WinUI](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2020/07/07/a-deep-dive-into-winui-3-in-desktop-apps/).  WinUI is a UI Framework that uses XAML markup language for defining the UI layout, control, styles, animation, etc. WinUI is the evolution of UWP XAML, which comes from SilverLight ( âš° RIP), the little brother of WPF. WinUI also works with .NET and C++, so C# and C++/17 are the two languages I use more. Although being honest, I prefer to write code in C#.
These days I'm coordinating the Windows App SDK and WinUI3, making sure we have the right features, product usage and growth, and the best possible quality.

More things about me. I'm from Spain, [Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville) (you should visit my hometown), and now I live in Seattle. I fell in love with computers when I was a kid when I learned how to create things programming in GWBASIC at 11 years old. I created my digital catalog for my Marvel comic book collection at 12 (I love books and comics books). When I was a teenager, around 15, I created video games in C and ASM. Before being a Product Manager, I was a developer, researcher, developer evangelist, and application development manager for several years. Also, Microsoft rewarded me with the Valuable Profesional award in ASP.NET (.NET web development).
